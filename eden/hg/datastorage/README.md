This directory contains a copy of a selection of sources from our mercurial
extensions in the facebook-hg-rpms/fb-hgext directory.

The purpose of mirroring the sources here is to allow eden to directly
operate on datapacks and tree manifest data structures produced by
mercurial.

If you find that you need to modify the code under here, please submit it
against the facebook-hg-rpms/fb-hgext repo for review before landing the
diff against this repo so that we maintain the source of truth and
trickle the changes down from there to here.
